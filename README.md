# Fun Calculator ðŸŽ‰

Welcome to the **Fun Calculator** â€” your mini toolkit for adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing two numbers like a boss! ðŸ˜Ž

## Overview

This program lets you enter two decimal numbers, then performs basic arithmetic operations on them: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Itâ€™s simple, fun, and a great way to see Python math in action!

## How It Works

1. **User Input:**
   - Prompts you to enter the first number (supports decimals).
   - Prompts you to enter the second number (supports decimals).
   
2. **Calculations:**
   - Adds the two numbers.
   - Subtracts the second number from the first.
   - Multiplies the two numbers.
   - Divides the first number by the second (make sure the second one isnâ€™t zero!).

3. **Output:**
   - Displays the sum, difference, product, and quotient.

## Usage

Run the script and follow the prompts:  
```
Enter the first number: 12.5  
Enter the second number: 3.2
```

Sample output will be:  
```
Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 15.7
Difference: 9.3
Product: 40.0
Quotient: 3.90625
```

## Notes

- The program uses `float()` for input to handle decimal numbers.
- Be careful not to divide by zero; the program currently assumes valid input.
- Great for beginners learning basic Python and arithmetic operations.
